# Milestone-2-Assignments-
Principal components analysis and Logistics regression
import all relevant libraries for the analysis
loading the cancer dataset from sklearn.dataset
creating PCA objects and fit the pca to the model.
transfroming dataset with  dimensionality reduction 
plotting the data points indicating 0 as malignant, and 1 as Benign on a scattered plot indicating approptiate axis labels  
Atempting the Logistic regression by splitting the dataset into train and test module using train_test_split function.
PCA fitting of the train data and data transformation of X_test, X_train 
Creating an instance of model and fitting of the train,test features learning the relationship between traing and target model
checking our model prediction accuracy and finally displaying the confusion matrix for the logistic regression.
